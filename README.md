### Introduction

Welcome to my implementation of the popular K-Means algorithm, now enhanced with GPU acceleration! By leveraging the power of GPUs, this implementation outperforms Scikit-learn's K-Means, particularly on large datasets. Enjoy faster clustering with the same robust results, making it an excellent choice for your data science and machine learning projects.

The implementation is in main.py file.
